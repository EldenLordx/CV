        "It's challenging to process data as it comes in different shapes and sizes. OmniParse aims to be an ingestion/parsing platform where you can ingest any type of data, such as documents, images, audio, video, and web content, and get the most structured and actionable output that is GenAI (LLM) friendly.\n",
